## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Desktop-first workflow
- Google Fonts for custom typography

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my ability to work with **flexbox** for centering elements on a page. Additionally, I worked with **CSS custom properties** to maintain a consistent color scheme and better readability.

Here's an example of the `container` styling I used:

```css
.container {
  width: 320px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 17px;
  padding: 15px;
}
```

I also experimented with font integration using Google Fonts:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-size: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to dive deeper into responsive design, making sure my layouts look perfect on all screen sizes. I also plan to further explore modern CSS layout techniques such as **CSS Grid**.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me better understand flexbox for positioning the elements centrally.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used the Outfit font for this project, and Google Fonts provided easy integration into my CSS.
